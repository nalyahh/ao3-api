# 📖 AO3 Fanfic Data Fetcher API 💖

Hi there! 👋 This is passion project API I built to grab metadata (like the title, author, word count, etc.) from fanfiction hosted on Archive of Our Own (AO3). 📚

This was a personal project intended to make a library database page in my Notion! It's also to help me learn more about **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **web scraping**! 🌟
